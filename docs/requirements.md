  Kernel requirements per gadget.

Inspektor Gadget uses eBPF to obtain the insights it provides. The
different gadgets provided use different eBPF capabilities.  The
capabilities available depend on the version of the kernel running in the
node, as well as whether or not the kernel has
[BTF](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html) enabled (via
`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`).

The required BTF information for some well known kernel versions is
generated with [BTFGen](https://github.com/kinvolk/btfgen) and shipped
within the gadget container image. If there are not shipped types for
the running kernel then they are downloaded from
[BTFhub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/).

## Required Kernel Versions

This section summarizes the kernel versions and features that are required to
run the gadgets. This has been generated by testing different Ubuntu versions
and their shipped kernels, hence it's possible that some gadgets work in older
kernels than the one mentioned here.
