  Kernel requirements per gadget.

Inspektor Gadget uses eBPF to obtain the insights it provides. The
different gadgets provided use different eBPF capabilities.  The
capabilities available depend on the version of the kernel running in the
node, as well as whether or not the kernel has
[BTF](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html) enabled (via
`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`).

For some well known kernel versions, the lack of BTF is remediated by
downloading the symbols from
[btfhub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/).

## Required Kernel Versions

This section summarizes the kernel versions and features that are required to
run the gadgets. This has been generated by testing different Ubuntu versions
and their shipped kernels, hence it's possible that some gadgets work in older
kernels than the one mentioned here.
