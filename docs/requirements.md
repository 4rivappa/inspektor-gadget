  Kernel requirements per gadget.

Inspektor Gadget uses eBPF to obtain the insights it provides. The
different gadgets provided use different eBPF capabilities.  The
capabilities available depend on the version of the kernel running in the
node, as well as whether or not the kernel has
[BTF](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html) enabled (via
`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`).

Some of the gadgets have two different implementations. The first is
based on the [traditional BCC
tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/tools), in this case
they are compiled at runtime on the target machine before loading. These
tools usually work on older kernels (~4.15) and require to have the
kernel headers available or the `IKHEADERS` module loaded. The second
implementation uses the modern Compile Once - Run Everywhere (CO:RE)
approach. These tools are not compiled at runtime and it's needed to
have BTF information. This information is collected from three different
sources, a fallback mechanism is implemented to try another source if the
previous one was not available.
1. The kernel already exposes it through `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`: the
   kernel was compiled with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF`).
2. It's available in the gadget container image: we ship the BTF
   information for some well known kernel versions using
   [BTFGen](https://github.com/kinvolk/btfgen).
3. It's downloaded from
   [BTFHub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/).

Inspektor Gadget always tries to use the CO:RE implementation of the
gadget (when available), if it fails then it falls back to the
traditional BCC-based implementation.

## Required Kernel Versions

This section summarizes the kernel versions and features that are required to
run the gadgets. This has been generated by testing different Ubuntu versions
and their shipped kernels, hence it's possible that some gadgets work in older
kernels than the one mentioned here.
